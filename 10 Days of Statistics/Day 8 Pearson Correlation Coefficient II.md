The regression line of $y$ on $x$ is $3x + 4y + 8 = 0$, and the regression line of $x$ on $y$ is $4x + 3y + 7 = 0$. What
is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

# Solution

$y = -\frac{3}{4}x-2$

$x = -\frac{3}{4}-\frac{7}{4}$

$\rightarrow b_{1} = -\frac{3}{4}$ and $b_{2} = -\frac{3}{4}$

* Let $p =$ pearson coefficient
* Let $sigma_x =$ standard deviation of x
* Let $sigma_y =$ standard deviation of y

$p = b_{1}(sigma_x/sigma_y)$  
$p = b_{2}(sigma_y/sigma_x)$

$\rightarrow p^{2} = b_{1}*b_{2}$

$p^{2} = -\frac{3}{4}*-\frac{3}{4}$

$p^{2} = \frac{9}{16}$

$\rightarrow p = -\frac{3}{4}$ or $p = \frac{3}{4}$

Both of the original line equations have negative slopes, so $x$ and $y$ are negatively correlated.  
$\Rightarrow p = -\frac{3}{4}$
