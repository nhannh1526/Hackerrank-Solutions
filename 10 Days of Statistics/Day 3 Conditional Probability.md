# Task

Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

# Solution

A: One of children is a boy  
B: Both children are boys

$P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$

$P(A \cap B) = P(B) = \frac{1}{4}$

$P(A) = \frac{3}{4}$

$P(B \mid A) = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1}{3}$
