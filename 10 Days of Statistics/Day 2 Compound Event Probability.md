# Task
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.
* Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
* Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
* Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

# Solution
Sample Space (S): 7C1 * 9C1 * 8C1 = 504  
Event (A): 4C1 * 5C1 * 4C1 + 4C1 * 4C1 * 4C1 + 3C1 * 5C1 * 4C1 = 204  
$P(A)$: $\frac{|A|}{|S|}$ = $\frac{204}{504}$ = $\frac{17}{42}$
