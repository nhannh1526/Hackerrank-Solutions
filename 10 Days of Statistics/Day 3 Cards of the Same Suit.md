# Task
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

# Solution
* For the first card: We can draw randomly from 52 cards.
* For the second card: There are only 12 cards in 51 cards left that have suit as same as the first card
  
$\Rightarrow$ Hence, result is $\frac{12}{51}$
