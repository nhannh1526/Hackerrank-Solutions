# Task
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

# Solution
Sample Space (S): 6C1 * 6C1 = 36  
Event (A): $\{(1, 5), (5, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4)\}$ = 4  
$P(A)$: $\frac{|A|}{|S|}$ = $\frac{4}{36}$ = $\frac{1}{9}$
