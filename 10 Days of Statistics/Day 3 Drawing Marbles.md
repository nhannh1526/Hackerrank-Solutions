# Task

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement.
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

# Solution

A: The first marble drawn is red  
B: The second marble is blue

$P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$

$P(A \cap B) = \frac{\binom{3}{1} * \binom{4}{1}}{\binom{7}{1} * \binom{6}{1}} = \frac{2}{7}$

${P(A)} = \frac{3}{7}$

$P(B \mid A) = \frac{\frac{2}{7}}{\frac{3}{7}} = \frac{2}{3}$
