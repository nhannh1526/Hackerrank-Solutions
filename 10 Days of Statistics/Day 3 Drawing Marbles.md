# Task
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

# Solution
A: The first marble drawn is red  
B: The second marble is blue  

$P(B \mid A)$ = $\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$  

$P(A \cap B)$ = $\frac{3C1 * 4C1}{7C1 * 6C1}$ = $\frac{2}{7}$  

${P(A)}$ = $\frac{3}{7}$  

$P(B \mid A)$ = $\frac{\frac{2}{7}}{\frac{3}{7}}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$
